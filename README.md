# Cryptosquare

#### By Will Johnson

## Description

A decently complex Intro to Programming assignment to encrypt a user input in a very specific way. Although a majority of the encryption was developed, it is not complete, and the testing isn't very thorough. At the time this was too complex of a problem to understand how testing would play into it, even though that would be the best point to use testing.
